                        <p class="card-text">The game consists of up to 50 players falling from a parachute on an island in search of weapons and equipment to kill the other players. Players are free to choose their starting position, take weapons and supplies to extend their battle life.

                            When players join a game, they will enter a plane, which will fly over the island. While the plane is flying over the island, the players can jump where they want, thus allowing them to choose a strategic place to land away from enemies. After landing, the players must then go looking for weapons and utility items. Medical equipment, medium and large weapons, grenades, and other items featured can be found throughout the island. The ultimate goal of the players is to survive on the island with a maximum of 50-51 players online; this requires eliminating all opponents the players encounter along the way and ensuring that they are the only survivor remaining. The available safe area of the game's map decreases in size over time, directing the surviving players into tighter areas to force encounters. The last player or team standing wins the round.  </p>

                        <p class="card-text">Among Us is a multiplayer game for four to ten players. Up to three players are randomly[9] chosen to be the impostor(s) each round. A round can take place on one of four maps: a spaceship called "The Skeld"; a headquarters building called "MIRA HQ"; a planet base called "Polus";[10] or "The Airship".At the start of the game, Crewmates are assigned "tasks" to complete around the map in the form of minigames, consisting of maintenance work on vital systems such as fixing wires and downloading data. Impostors are given a fake list of tasks to blend in with Crewmates. However, they cannot legitimately perform tasks. Impostors can sabotage vital systems (such as the ship's oxygen supply), covertly travel through vents, and work with other Impostors to kill Crewmates. If a player dies, they become a ghost. Ghosts can pass through walls, spectate other players, and chat with other ghosts. Living players have a limited cone of vision, but ghosts do not have this limitation.</p>

While escorting a police convoy carrying prisoners to the rebuilt Raft, Miles accidentally frees Rhino, who wreaks havoc in Harlem. While Miles stops the other escapees, Peter struggles against Rhino, who eventually overpowers him. Miles intervenes and defeats Rhino with his new bio-electric ability, later dubbed "Venom Blast". Leaving Rhino in Roxxon's custody.Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales is a 2020 action-adventure game developed by Insomniac Games and published by Sony Interactive Entertainment for the PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5. Based on the Marvel Comics superhero Miles Morales, it is inspired by both the character's almost decade-long comic book mythology, and the 2018 animated film Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse, which helped to popularize him</p>
